/// Crypto service provider (CSP) client for distributed key generation
///
/// # Distributed Key Generation
/// ## Motivation
/// With a standard threshold signature scheme, one entity generates all the
/// signatories' keys and so is in a position to abuse that power.  In
/// distributed key generation, multiple actors, called dealers, collaborate to
/// generate the signatories secret key material in a way that no strict subset
/// of dealers has sufficient information to abuse their position.
///
/// ## Usage
/// * The participants are divided into dealers, who contribute to key
///   generation, and receivers, who will be threshold signatories.
/// * Ephemeral key phase:
///   * All participants generate an ephemeral DiffieHellman key and share their
///     ephemeral public keys with the other participants.  This key should be
///     used for one DKG and then discarded.
///   * All participants should verify that the ephemeral public keys are
///     plausibly correct and evict any participants whose public keys are
///     invalid.
/// * Dealing phase:
///   * The dealers each individually generate a threshold polynomial and
///     publish it as a 'dealing'.  The secret keys for the receivers are
///     encrypted with DiffieHellman and published with the polynomial; only the
///     corresponding receivers can decrypt the secret keys.
///   * All participants verify that the dealings look plausibly correct and
///     reject any dealings that are invalid.
/// * Complaint phase:
///   * Each receiver individually decrypts their secret key in each dealing and
///     verifies that it is correct; if not they generate a complaint against
///     that dealer.
///   * Each participant verifies that the complaints are superficially valid,
///     rejecting any that are not.
/// * Transcript phase
///   * Each participant examines the complaints and verifies the zero knowledge
///     proof that should be included in a complaint.  If a complaint is
///     invalid, all complaints by that receiver are disregarded.  Of the
///     remaining complaints, any dealings that have been proven to be invalid
///     are rejected.  The remaining valid dealings are combined to generate the
///     threshold key.  The valid dealings, together with the threshold public
///     key, are published as the transcript.
///   * Individual signatories compute their threshold secret key from the
///     transcript, decrypting their shares using their ephemeral DiffieHellman
///     key.  The ephemeral key is then deleted to protect the threshold key
///     from compromise.
///
/// # Resharing
/// ## Motivation
/// Signatories may cease to exist or be forced to retire.  Under these
/// circumstances it may be desirable to find a new set of signatories to
/// replace the old.  However it is desirable for such a change to be invisible
/// from the perspective of a user wishing to verify threshold signatures.  That
/// is, it is desirable for the public threshold coefficient at zero to remain
/// the same when there is a change of signatories.  The resharing scheme
/// achieves this.
///
/// ## Usage
/// The resharing protocol is the same as the distributed key generation
/// protocol with these modifications:
/// * A threshold key must preexist.
/// * Signatories of the previous threshold key are the dealers during the
///   resharing DKG.
/// * The arguments and calculation differ slightly at some of the steps in the
///   protocol.
///
/// # On the inclusion of self in otherwise static methods
///
/// A CSP client categorizes the offered methods in two categories:
/// * methods that are served non-statically by calling out to a CSP (server)
///   which includes RPC calls (incl. serialization of parameters and
///   deserialization of return values)
/// * methods that are served statically by computing the output locally, that
///   is, without having to make RPC calls, which are comparatively expensive.
///
/// When implementing this scheme,
/// * the methods dkg_create_ephemeral, dkg_create_dealing and
///   dkg_load_private_key are computed non-statically
/// * all other methods are computed statically
///
/// The methods in this trait that are meant to be served statically are
/// intentionally made non-static (i.e., they take a `&self` parameter) so that
/// mocking of this trait (for testing purposes) is possible.

/// Crypto service provider (CSP) client for non-interactive distributed key
/// generation (NiDKG).
///
/// # Distributed Key Generation
/// ## Motivation
/// With a standard threshold signature scheme, one entity generates all the
/// signatories' keys and so is in a position to abuse that power.  In
/// distributed key generation, multiple actors, called dealers, collaborate to
/// generate the signatories secret key material in a way that no strict subset
/// of dealers has sufficient information to abuse their position.
///
/// Non-interactive DKG is a design that is easy to use because there is
/// effectively only a single step:  Dealers deal shares and can then cease to
/// exist, as far as the protocol is concerned.  Receivers likewise do not need
/// to communicate with each other; they can read the dealings written by the
/// dealers and proceed without further ado.  Not only is this design
/// convenient, it also enables use cases in which it is hard for participants
/// to coordinate with each other.
///
/// ## Usage
/// Participants may be dealers, who contribute to key generation, or receivers,
/// who will be threshold signatories, or both.
///
/// ### Dealing
///   * The dealers each individually generate a threshold polynomial and
///     publish it as a 'dealing'.  The secret keys for the receivers are
///     encrypted with a forward secure encryption scheme and published with the
///     polynomial; only the corresponding receivers can decrypt the secret
///     keys.
///   * Each dealing should be verified and accepted only if sound.
/// ### Receiving
///   * The receivers each read the dealings and compile them into a transcript.
///   * Each receiver can compute their secret threshold key from the transcript
///     and so contribute to threshold signatures.
///
/// ## Resharing
/// ### Motivation
/// Signatories may cease to exist or be forced to retire.  Under these
/// circumstances it may be desirable to find a new set of signatories to
/// replace the old.  However it is desirable for such a change to be invisible
/// from the perspective of a user wishing to verify threshold signatures.  That
/// is, it is desirable for the public threshold coefficient at zero to remain
/// the same when there is a change of signatories.  The resharing scheme
/// achieves this.
///
/// ### Usage
/// The resharing protocol is the same as the distributed key generation
/// protocol with these modifications:
/// * A threshold key must preexist.
/// * Signatories of the previous threshold key are the dealers during the
///   resharing DKG.
/// * The arguments and calculation differ slightly at some of the steps in the
///   protocol.
