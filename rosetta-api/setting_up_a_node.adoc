=== Setting up a node

To keep the instructions simple, the integration with the Rosetta API is encapsulated in a Docker image.
If you don't already have Docker on your local computer, download and install the latest version.


. https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[Install docker] and https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/[start the `dockerd` daemon].

. Pull the latest `dfinity/rosetta-api` image down from Docker Hub by running the following command:

[source,bash]
....
docker pull dfinity/rosetta-api
....

. Run the image by running the following command:

[source,bash]
....
docker run \
    --interactive \
    --tty \
    --publish 8080:8080 \
    --rm \
   dfinity/rosetta-api
....

Optionally, you can run the command above with an additional `canister` argument if you have been assigned a testnet. For example, the following command illustrates running the command using the `canister` argument set to "2xh5f-viaaa-aaaab-aae3q-cai".

[source,bash]
....
docker run \
    --interactive \
    --tty \
    --publish 8080:8080 \
    --rm \
   dfinity/rosetta-api
   --canister 2xh5f-viaaa-aaaab-aae3q-cai
....

On first run, the node may take a while to catch up to the current tip of the chain. Objects will be saved to the `/data `directory inside the image.

Once you are at all caught up, you should see output similar to like this:

....
You are all caught up to block height 100
....

After completing this step, the node continues to run as a **passive** node  that does not participate in block making.

=== Reading/Writing transactions with a node

While there are a number of ways to interact with ICP tokens on the Internet Computer, the best supported one is https://www.rosetta-api.org/[the Rosetta API]. The Rosetta API is a https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/welcome.html[well documented open standard] that supports a number of blockchains and is designed to support exchange workflows.
=== Requirements and limitations
We do add one conditions not found in the Rosetta API documentation. If you are creating a new transaction you must create the unsigned transaction no more than 24 hours before the network receives the signed transaction.

This implementation of the Rosetta API is fully-compliant with all standard endpoints and passes all of the `rosetta-cli` tests. The implementation can accept any valid Rosetta request.  However, it only replies with a small subset of the potential responses that the specification supports.

The integration for ICP tokens only prompts for transactions to be signed using Ed25519, rather than https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/models/SignatureType.html#values[all the signature schemes listed here].

The software doesn't implement any of the UTXO features of Rosetta, so you won't see them in any of our responses.

Below are some examples of the kinds of requests and responses that our node will expect/return.

=== The ICP Token

The ICP token is very closely modeled off Bitcoin, with some small differences.
- Rather than using proof of work, staked participant nodes use a variant of BLS to agree on a valid state of the chain.
- Any transaction can store an 8-byte memo, which can be used to disambiguate payments received by a payee.

But it is broadly the same as Bitcoin.
- Each ICP token is divisible 10^8 times.
- All transactions are stored in the ledger starting with the genesis initial state.
- Tokens are entirely fungible.
- Account identifiers are 23 bytes and derived from a public key.
