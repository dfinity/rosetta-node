= The ledger canister =

This document is a specification of the public interface of the Ledger Canister.  It provides an overview of the functionality, details some internal aspects, and documents publicly available methods. We also provide an abstract mathematical model which makes precise the expected behavior of the methods implemented by the canister, albeit at a somewhat high level of abstraction.

NOTE: Parts of the canister interface are for internal consumption only, and therefore not part of this specification. However, whenever relevant, we do provide some insights into those aspects as well.


=== Overview & terminology ===


In brief, the Ledger canister maintains a set of accounts owned by IC principals; each account has associated an ICP tokens balance. Account owners can initiate the transfer of tokens from the accounts they control to any other ledger account.
All transfer operations are recorded on an append-only transaction ledger.  The interface of the ledger canister also allows minting and burning of tokens, which are additional transactions which are recorded on the transaction ledger.
// A privileged API supports minting new ICP tokens.
//The Ledger canister leverages certified variables to authenticate to third parties the content of the transaction ledger.



==== Internet Computer Protocol tokens (ICP) ====
ICP tokens are the utility tokens of the Internet Computer Protocol. The smallest indivisible unit of ICP are "e8"s: one e8 is 10^-8^ ICP.


==== Accounts ====
The ledger canister keeps track of accounts:

* Every account belongs to (and is controlled by) an IC principal
* Each account has precisely one owner (i.e. no “joint accounts”)
*  A principal may control more than one account.  We distinguish between the different accounts of the same principal via a (32-byte string) subaccount_identifier.  So, logically, each ledger account corresponds to a pair `(account_owner, subaccount_identifier)`.
* The account identifier corresponding to such a pair is a 32-byte string calculated as follows:

....
account_identifier(principal,subbaccount_identifier) = CRC32(h) || h

where

h = sha224(“\x0Aaccount-id” || principal || subaccount_identifier)
....

That is, the account identifier (or sometimes simply, the account) corresponding to a principal and a sub-account identifier is obtained by hashing using sha224 the concatenation of domain separator “\x0Aaccount-id”, the principal and the sub-account identifier, and prepended with
the CRC32 of the resulting hash value.


** For any principle, we refer to the account which corresponds to the all-0 subaccount_identifier as the default account of a principle.

** The default account of the governance canister plays an important role in minting/burning tokens (see below), and we refer to it as the `minting_account_id`.



==== Operations, transactions, blocks , transaction ledger ====

Account balances change as the result of one of three operations: sending tokens from one account to another, minting tokens to an account and burning tokens from an account.  Each operation is triggered by a call to the ledger and is recorded as a transaction: in addition to the details of the operation a transaction includes a Memo field (a 64 bit number), and a timestamp indicating the time at which the transaction was created.


Each transaction is included in a block (there is only one transaction per block) and blocks are "chained" by including in each block the hash of the previous block.  The position of a block in the ledger is called the block index;  counting starting from 0.


The types used to represent these concepts are specified below in Candid syntax.


Basic datatypes::
....

type Tokens = record {
     e8s : nat64;
};



// Account identifier  is a 32-byte array.
// The first 4 bytes is big-endian encoding of a CRC32 checksum of the last 28 bytes
type AccountIdentifier = blob;


//There are three types of operations: minting tokens, burning tokens & transferring tokens
type Transfer = variant {
    Mint: record {
        to: AccountIdentifier;
        amount: Tokens;
    };
    Burn: record {
         from: AccountIdentifier;
         amount: Tokens;
   };
    Send: record {
        from: AccountIdentifier;
        to: AccountIdentifier;
        amount: Tokens;
    };
};

type Memo = u64;

// Timestamps are represented as nanoseconds from the UNIX epoch in UTC timezone
type TimeStamp = record {
    timestamp_nanos: nat64;
};

Transaction = record {
    transfer: Transfer;
    memo: Memo;
    created_at_time: Timestamp;
};

Block = record {
    parent_hash: Hash;
    transaction: Transaction;
    timestamp: Timestamp;
};

type BlockIndex = nat64;

//The ledger is a list of blocks
type Ledger = vec Block

....
== Methods ==

The ledger canister implements methods to:

* transfer ICP from one account to another
* to get the balance of a ledger account
// * fetch a block of the chain, specified through its position in the ledger, aka its height.

==== Transferring tokens ====
The owner of an account can transfer tokens from that account to any other account using the `transfer` method.
The inputs to the method are as follows:

* `amount`: the amount of tokens to be transferred
* `fee`: the fee to be payed for the transfer
* `from_subaccount`: a sub-account identifier which specifies from which account of the caller the ICP should take place. This parameter is optional -- if it is not specified by the caller, then it is set to the all 0 vector.
* `to`: the account identifier to which the tokens should be transferred
* `memo`: this is a 64-bit number chosen by the sender; it can be used in various ways, e.g. to identify specific transfers.
* `created_at_time`: a timestamp indicating when the transaction was created by the caller -- if it is not specified by the caller then this is set to the current IC time.


The ledger canister executes a `transfer` call as follows:

* checks that the destination is a well-formed account identifier
* checks that the transaction is recent enough (has been created within the last 24 hours) and is not "in the future" (`created_at_time` is in the future by more than an allowed time drift, specified by a parameter in the IC, currently set at 60 seconds)
* calculates the source account (using the calling principal and `from_subaccount`) and checks that it holds more than amount+fee ICP
* checks that `fee` matches the `standard_fee`  (currently, the standard fee is a fixed constant set to be 10^-4^ ICP, see below for an exception)
* checks that an identical transaction has not been submitted in the last 24 hours
* if any of the checks fails, it returns an appropriate error
* otherwise it
** substracts amount+fee from the source account
** adds amount to the destination account
** adds transaction `(Send(from, to, amount, fee), memo, created_at_time)` to the ledger and returns the height of the block containing the transaction.



==== Burning and minting tokens ====
Typical transfers move ICP from one account to another.
An important exception is when either the source or the destination of a transfer is the special  `minting_account_id`.
The effect of a transfer to the minting account is that the tokens are simply removed from the source account and not deposited anywhere; the tokens are burned.
Burn transactions are recorded on the ledger as `(Burn(from,amount))`.
Importantly, the fee for a burn transfer is 0, but the amount of tokens to be burned must exceed the `standard_fee`.

The effect of a transfer from the `minting_account_id` account is that tokens are simply added to the destination account; the tokens are minted.
When invoked, the transaction `(Mint(to,amount))` is added to the transaction ledger.
Notice that the `minting_account_id` is controlled by the Governance canister which makes minting tokens a privileged operation only available to this  canister.


The candid signature of the `transfer` method, together with some additional required datatypes is below.



Additional datatypes & canister methods::
----
type SendArgs = record {
    memo: Memo;
    amount: Tokens;
    fee: Tokens;
    from_subaccount: opt SubAccount;
    to: AccountIdentifier;
    created_at_time: opt TimeStamp;
};



// Arguments for the `transfer` call.
type TransferArgs = record {
    memo: Memo;
    amount: Tokens;
    fee: Tokens;
    from_subaccount: opt SubAccount;
    to: Address;
    created_at_time: opt TimeStamp;
};

type TransferError = variant {
    // The fee specified in the send request was not the one the ledger expects.
    BadFee : record { expected_fee : Tokens; };
    // The sender's (sub)account doesn't have enough funds for completing the transaction. Return an error with the debit account balance.
    InsufficientFunds : record { balance: Tokens; };
    // The transaction is too old, the ledger only accepts transactions created within 24 hours window. Return an error with the allowed time-window size in nanoseconds.
    TxTooOld : record { allowed_window_nanos: nat64 };
    // `created_at_time` is in future.
    TxCreatedInFuture : null;
    // The transaction was already submitted before.
    TxDuplicate : record { duplicate_of: BlockIndex; }
};

type TransferResult = variant {
    Ok : BlockIndex;
    Err : TransferError;
};


service : {
  transfer : (TransferArgs) -> (TransferResult);
}

==== Balance ====

A transaction ledger tracks the balances of all accounts in the natural way (see the Semantics session below for a more formal definition).

Any principal can obtain the balance of an arbitrary account via the method `account_balance`: the input parameter is the account identifier; the result is the balance associated to the account.
The balance of the account with account identifier `minting_account_id` is always 0; the balance of any other account is calculated in the obvious way.

----
type AccountBalanceArgs = record {
    account: Address;
};

service : {
  // Get the amount of ICP on the specified account.
  account_balance : (AccountBalanceArgs) -> (Tokens) query;
}
----



== Semantics ==

In this section we provide a semantics of the public methods exposed by the ledger.  We use somewhat ad-hoc mathematical notation which we keep close to the notation introduced above.
We use  " · " to denote list concatenation. We write `default_subaccount` for the all-0 vector. If L is a list then we write |L| for the length of a list L and L[i] for the i'th element of L. The first element of L is L[0].




==== Basic types ====


-----

Operation =
  Transfer = {
    from: AccountIdentifier;
    to: AccountIdentifier;
    amount: Tokens;
    fee: Tokens;
  } |
  Mint = {
    to: AccountIdentifier;
    amount: Tokens;
  } |
  Burn = {
    from: AccountIdentifier;
    amount: Tokens;
  }
}

Block = {
   operation: Operation;
   memo: Memo;
   created_at_time: Timestamp;
   hash: Hash;
  }

Ledger = List(Block)
-----


==== Ledger State ====
The state of the Ledger canister comprises:

 * the transaction ledger (a chained list of blocks containing transactions);
 * global variables:
 ** `last_hash`: an optional variable which records the hash of the last block in the ledger; it is set to None if no block is present in the ledger.

-----
State = {
  ledger: Ledger;
  last_hash: Hash | None;
};
-----

Initially, the ledger is set to the empty list and `last_hash` is set to None:

----
 {
   ledger = [];
   last_hash = None;
}
----



==== Balances ====

Given a transaction ledger, we define the `balance` function which associates to a ledger account its ICP balance.

-----
balance: Ledger x AccountIdentifier -> Nat
-----


The function is defined, recursively, as follows:

....
balance([],account_id) = 0

if (B = Block{Transfer{from,to,amount, fee}, memo, time, hash}) and (to = account_id)) |
   (B = Block{Mint{to, amount}, memo, time}) and (to = account_id)) then
   then
   balance(OlderBlocks · [B] , account_id) = balance(OlderBlocks, account_id) + amount,

if (B = Block{Transfer{from,to,amount,fee},memo,time}} and (from = account_id)
    then
    balance(OlderBlocks · [B], account_id) = balance(OlderBlocks,account_id) - (amount+fee)

if (B = Block{Burn{from,amount}) and (from = account_id)
   then
   balance(OlderBlocks · [B], account_id) = balance(OlderBlocks,account_id) - amount

otherwise
  balance(OlderBlocks · [B], account_id) = balance(OlderBlocks, account_id)

....


We describe the semantics of ledger methods as a function which takes as input a ledger state, the call arguments and returns a (potentially) new state and a reply.
In the description of the function we use some additional functions which reflect system provided information.  These include `caller()` which returns the principal who invoked the method, `now()` which return the IC time and `drift` a constant indicating permissible time drift between IC and external time.
We also write `well_formed(.)` for a boolean valued function which checks that its input is a well-formed account identifier (i.e. the first four bytes are equal to CRC32 of the remaining 28 bytes).
